# BALLOTIQ
Blockchain-based voting system
BALLOTIQ is a blockchain-based voting platform designed to ensure security, transparency, decentralization, and voter privacy.
Only the admin has permission to view and publish the final election results, while voter identity remains fully anonymous on the blockchain.

This project demonstrates how blockchain principles can solve real-world election challenges—such as trust, tamper-proof records, and verifiable vote counts.
